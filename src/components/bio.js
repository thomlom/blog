        Hi! I'm Thomas Lombart, a front-end engineer.

        I'm Thomas, a french front-end engineer at Back Market. I write and
        speak about code, design and everything in between. I also contribute to
        open source when I'm not busy doing other things. On a personal side, I
        love travelling, training, watching good movies (and listening to their
        soundtracks). Feel free to reach out to me!
